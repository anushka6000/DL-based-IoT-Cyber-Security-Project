# Motivation 
As the Internet of Things is becoming a part of our lives by connecting a large number of devices we use daily, it is also essential to develop systems that prevent data breach by detecting suspicious activities and alerting users. There have been many attempts at developing Intrusion Detection Systems to solve the above purpose but none achieve 100% accuracy. Motivated by this, we try to improve intrusion detection systems by trying various machine learning and deep learning methods. Here I have performed an attack vs non-attack classification on the BoT-IoT dataset. I have achieved an overall best accuracy score of 1 for attack vs non-attack classification with the help of a Semi-Supervised Learning model.

# Dataset Used
I have used the BoT-IoT dataset to perform the task. Link to the dataset:
